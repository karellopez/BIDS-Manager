"""The test matrix: every tier, on every supported Python.

Run it anywhere. That is the whole point: this file is the ONE definition of
"run the tests", so the Mac, the Windows box, the Linux box and any CI all do
the identical thing instead of four shell invocations that drift apart.

    nox -l                  # list what there is

Interpreters come from ``uv``, which downloads any it does not have. There is
no pyenv, no conda and no manual install step: a machine needs uv and a git
checkout, and the matrix works. Measured on this Mac, a cold 3.12 environment
builds and runs the 1,417 unit tests in about 40 seconds.

Why nox and not tox: the matrix has conditional shape (the GUI tier needs an
offscreen platform, the real-data tier needs env vars and is skipped when they
are absent), and expressing that in Python is honest where expressing it in
ini syntax is a puzzle.
