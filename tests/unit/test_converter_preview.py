Two complaints this addresses, both real. A form that omits a required field
because a converter fills it looks like a form that forgot it. And the list of
"what a converter fills" was measured once, on one tree, with one scanner, so a
field the user's scanner supplies but ours did not was asked for AND reported as
already filled in, in the same form.
