"""Where the head is, where the air is, and the air not to measure.

The air around the head is where noise and artefacts are measured (ghosts,
ringing, motion, wrap-around). Three kinds of "air" are not air and would
make every such measure meaningless:

- **zero fill**: voxels set to exactly zero by the scanner or a resampling
  (a rotated field of view, a background the scanner blanks);
- **defacing**: the face and ears set to zero to protect identity. The
  check measures air ONLY in images that are not defaced (the sidecar
  records defacing, ``deface.status``; an image whose face region is blank
  is treated the same, with or without a record);
- **the face, neck and shoulders**: below the plane through the glabella
  and the inion, where folding and motion are normal (MRIQC's "hat").

Head and air masks are made on the working grid (about 2 mm) and expanded
to the image's grid only where a measure needs it.
