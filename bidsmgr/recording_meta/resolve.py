"""Resolve the effective enrichment for one recording.

Merges the dataset-wide ``defaults`` with the per-recording ``overrides`` and
picks the task-scoped event map and protocol. The result is a flat object the
enrichment step consumes. Per-row inventory cells (montage, line_freq, reference,
ground) take precedence over the resolved spec and are layered on by the caller
(the convert verb), so this module stays spec-only and pure.

Precedence (low to high): ``defaults`` < ``overrides[row_id]`` < inventory cells.
