"""Recording-level enrichment metadata: pure-data models + resolution + I/O.

This subpackage holds the information a raw recording cannot carry on its own,
as I/O-free Pydantic models, plus the logic to resolve a dataset-default-plus-
per-row-override spec into a single effective view for one recording.

Two modality blocks live here, because two modalities have facts their files
cannot express. EEG/MEG/iEEG needs reference, ground, filters, device, cap,
event-code meaning and task protocol. PET needs the radiochemistry: how much
tracer, in what form, administered when. MRI needs neither, since dcm2niix
reads everything BIDS wants straight out of the DICOM header. Alongside both
sit the modality-agnostic parts (institution, events, phenotype, participants),
which is what lets one scaffold file serve a PET/MR study.

It imports only from :mod:`bidsmgr.schema` and standard scientific deps; it is
Qt-free and depends on no other ``bidsmgr`` subpackage.

The enrichment is *applied* to written BIDS files by
:mod:`bidsmgr.fixups.eeg_sidecar` and :mod:`bidsmgr.fixups.pet_sidecar`; this
subpackage only describes and resolves.
