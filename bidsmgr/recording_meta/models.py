"""Pure-data models for recording-level enrichment metadata.

These describe the information a recording file cannot carry on its own:
the reference and ground electrodes, hardware/software filters, amplifier and
cap details, institution, the meaning of trigger codes, and per-task protocol
notes. A scan seeds what it can detect; the user fills the rest. The models are
deliberately I/O-free (Pydantic v2 only): reading, writing, resolving, and
applying live in sibling modules.

Every leaf field is optional. Enrichment is *additive*: a field left unset means
"leave whatever the converter already wrote". The structure separates a single
dataset-wide ``defaults`` block from sparse per-recording ``overrides`` keyed by
the inventory row id, so a heterogeneous cohort (mixed caps, amplifiers, or
references) is expressible without repeating shared values.
