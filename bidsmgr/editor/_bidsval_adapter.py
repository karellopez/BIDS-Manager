"""Map :mod:`bidsval` results into BIDS Manager's ``editor/types`` shapes.

The GUI, workers, HTML report, and CLI all bind to
:class:`bidsmgr.editor.types.ValidationReport` / ``FileVerdict`` / ``Issue``.
bidsval returns near-isomorphic pydantic models; this module is the single
translation layer between the two, plus the BIDS Manager-native supplements
(``sidecar_fields`` + TODO findings from :mod:`bidsmgr.editor.bidsmgr_checks`).

Severity mapping: bidsval ``error`` / ``warning`` / ``ignore`` ->
``ERR`` / ``WARN`` / ``OK`` (a clean file, severity ``None``, also maps to ``OK``).

Finding attribution follows bidsval (and the BIDS spec): metadata findings for a
data file (for example a missing required ``RepetitionTime``) attach to the data
file (``*_bold.nii.gz``), not to its ``.json`` sidecar. The sidecar form still
shows which fields are missing because :func:`to_bm_file_verdict` populates
``sidecar_fields`` on the ``.json`` verdict from the schema.
