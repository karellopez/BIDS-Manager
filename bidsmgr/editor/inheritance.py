"""Where a sidecar value actually comes from, and moving it where it belongs.

BIDS lets a field common to many recordings live once, higher up the tree: a
``task-rest_bold.json`` at the dataset root applies to every matching file
below it. Two things follow, and the Editor helped with neither.

**A user editing a sidecar may be looking at a value that is not in it.** The
form shows the effective metadata, so ``RepetitionTime`` can appear on
``sub-01/func/..._bold.json`` while living in a file three levels up. Editing
it there writes a second copy and the two silently disagree from then on.
:func:`explain` answers "where is this value from", which is the cheaper and
more valuable half.

**A field repeated identically in every sibling belongs higher up.**
:func:`consolidation_candidates` finds those, and :func:`consolidate` moves one
up and deletes the copies, which is what the standard's inheritance is for.

The inheritance rule itself is BIDS's, so the applicable files are worked out
the way BIDS defines them: a sidecar applies to a data file when it sits at or
above the file's directory and its entities are a subset of the file's. That
is re-derived here rather than asked of bidsval only because bidsval answers it
per data file during validation and this needs the inverse question, which
sidecars could hold a value for a set of files.

Qt-free.
