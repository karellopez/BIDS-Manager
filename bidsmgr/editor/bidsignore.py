"""What ``.bidsignore`` says, and what it actually does to this dataset.

A pattern file is written blind: the user types ``derivatives/`` and finds out
whether it worked by running the validator and reading what disappeared. The
useful question, which nothing answers today, is **which files does this
pattern match right now**. A pattern matching nothing is almost always a typo,
and a pattern matching more than intended is how a real problem gets silenced.

So the model here is not a text file, it is a list of patterns each carrying
its current match count, computed against the dataset on disk.

Matching follows the ``.gitignore``-style rules BIDS specifies: a trailing
slash matches a directory and everything under it, a leading slash anchors to
the dataset root, ``*`` does not cross a path separator and ``**`` does.

Qt-free.
