"""The Citation File Format, as fields the Editor can render and check.

``CITATION.cff`` is not part of the BIDS schema, so guard 8 does not apply to
it: there is no authority to adapt, and the fields below are BIDS Manager's own
curated view of CFF 1.2.0. What IS schema-driven is where the values come from.
Everything BIDS already knows about a dataset is read from
``dataset_description.json``, whose fields the schema defines, so the citation
file restates the standard rather than asking the user again.

The field list is deliberately a useful subset, not the whole format. CFF 1.2.0
has around forty keys and most of them describe software releases; a dataset
citation needs a dozen. The rest of the file is preserved untouched when the
Editor saves, so a user who hand-writes a key this module has never heard of
does not lose it.

Parsing and writing go through PyYAML rather than string handling, because a
title with a colon in it is not a corner case.

Qt-free.
