"""Write one answer into every file it belongs in, and no others.

Two requests share this engine. Stating a field once for a whole study, and
fixing a finding in every file it fired on, are the same operation seen from
two directions: work out which files the field applies to, show the user what
each one says now and what it would say, and write only the ones they tick.

Three rules the engine keeps:

**Applicability comes from the schema, not from a filename pattern.** A file is
a candidate for ``EchoTime`` because the standard declares ``EchoTime`` for its
datatype and suffix. Globbing ``*_bold.json`` would sweep in a derivative that
should not have it and miss a suffix that should.

**Nothing is written that is already right.** A file whose value already equals
the new one is offered but marked unchanged, so a count of "12 files" means
twelve files that will actually differ.

**Nothing is written without the caller seeing it first.** :func:`candidates`
answers what would happen; :func:`apply_value` does it. They are separate calls
so a dialog can sit between them.

Qt-free.
