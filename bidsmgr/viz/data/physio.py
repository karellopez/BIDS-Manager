"""A ``*_physio.tsv.gz`` (or ``_stim``, or any continuous BIDS table) as a
signal.

A physio recording is a table of numbers with no header row, and reading one
as a table tells you almost nothing. Whether the trigger fired where you
expect, whether the ECG is flat for the first minute, whether the
respiratory belt came loose halfway through, are questions about the SHAPE
of the signal. So the file is turned into an ``mne.io.RawArray`` (decision
D8: every signal is an mne ``Raw``) and drawn by the same traces canvas, the
same filters and the same spectrum as MEG and EEG.

Three facts the plot needs are not in the file, and BIDS puts all three in
the sidecar, which is why this reads it rather than guessing:

``Columns``            what each column is, since the file has no header
``SamplingFrequency``  how far apart the samples are
``StartTime``          where sample zero sits relative to the run, which is
                       usually NEGATIVE because recording starts before the
                       scanner does

``StartTime`` used to be read and then dropped, so the physio time axis
started at zero and an events overlay drawn on it was off by exactly that
offset. It is now carried on the :class:`~.signal.SignalSource` and the
canvas draws in run time.

Channel TYPES are guessed from the column names: a column called
``cardiac`` becomes an MNE ``ecg`` channel, ``respiratory`` becomes
``resp``, a trigger becomes ``stim``. The viewer then colours them by kind,
groups them in the type filter, averages the spectrum per kind, and reads
events off the stim channel, all without knowing that physio exists.

Qt-free.
