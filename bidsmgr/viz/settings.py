"""Every viewer preference, as one typed model.

One schema instead of scattered ``AppSettings`` keys and module globals: the
crosshair, the defaults a newly opened image gets, the 3-D quality, how traces
are drawn, the user's keyboard and mouse bindings, and the layouts used.
Stored as JSON under the ``viz/`` namespace (``gui/viz/settings_store.py``)
and broadcast on change, so an open viewer follows a preference at once.

Each field carries what the Settings page needs to draw it, as data: a
title, a help text, and in ``json_schema_extra`` the widget hints (``range``,
``step``, ``unit``, ``kind`` for a colour or a colour map, ``labels`` for a
choice). The Viewer page is GENERATED from this module, so a preference added
here appears in Settings without anyone building a control for it.

Pure data; validation clamps rather than rejects, so a hand-edited or older
settings file still loads.
