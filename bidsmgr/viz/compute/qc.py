"""Quality maps of a time series: mean, standard deviation, temporal SNR.

The three images a functional run is judged by before anything else: where
the signal is (mean), where it moves (standard deviation: motion at the
edges, vessels, ghosts), and how much of it is signal (temporal SNR, mean
over SD, the number acquisition protocols are compared by).

Accumulated frame by frame in float64 sums, never as a float copy of the
series: the 1224-volume BOLD the viewer is measured on is 679 MB as stored
and would be 2.7 GB in float64. Runs on a worker.

Each map comes with what it takes to READ it (:data:`HELP`, :func:`summary`):
a colour without a scale and a sentence on what it means is a picture, not
a measurement.
