"""The scene: what is shown, and how, as plain data.

Every viewer in the library draws a :class:`Scene` and changes it only through
named commands (:mod:`bidsmgr.viz.commands`). That single path is what lets
the same state be saved, restored, synced between two viewers, scripted,
undone, and bound to any key, without any of those features knowing how a
canvas draws.

Pure data, as the architecture guards require: pydantic models with no I/O
and no reference to Qt. Mutable on purpose. A command changes a field in
place and reports which paths it touched, so a crosshair drag at 60 Hz costs
one attribute write instead of a rebuilt tree; immutable copies bought nothing
here but allocation.

Two vocabularies are worth fixing once, because the old viewer mixed them:

* a PLANE is which slice a 2-D view cuts (sagittal, coronal, axial);
* the WORLD is the scanner's coordinate system, in millimetres (RAS+: x grows
  toward the subject's right, y toward the front, z toward the top). The
  cursor lives in the world, never in one image's voxel grid, because the
  world is the only thing two images of the same head genuinely share.
