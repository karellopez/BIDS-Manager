"""The companion files a recording should have, and generating the missing ones.

BIDS associates files with each other by name: a task recording is expected to
have an ``events.tsv`` beside it, an electrophysiology recording a
``channels.tsv``, a data file a ``.json`` sidecar. A validator reports the ones
that are absent, and the user is then left to create them by hand in a text
editor, which is exactly the sort of work an editor should do.

One rule governs everything here, and it is the reason this module is careful
rather than eager:

**A generated file must not look authored.** An ``events.tsv`` with a header
and no rows satisfies a structural check while telling a reader nothing, and a
reader cannot tell it apart from a genuine recording with no events. So a stub
is written with the ``TODO`` convention BIDS Manager already uses for missing
recommended metadata, which the validator reports until a human replaces it.
The user is never quietly told a problem is solved when it has only been
hidden.

What can be derived is derived rather than stubbed: an electrophysiology
recording knows its own channel names, so ``channels.tsv`` is written from the
file rather than left blank.

Qt-free.
