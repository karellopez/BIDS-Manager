"""Schema-driven sidecar repairs that apply to every datatype.

The datatype-specific fixups next door know what a particular modality needs.
This one knows only what the SCHEMA says, and so applies everywhere:

* :func:`repair_key_names` fixes a key whose spelling differs from the
  standard's only in case. Real example, and the reason this exists: BIDS
  spells the field ``MISCChannelCount`` for EEG and ``MiscChannelCount`` for
  MEG and iEEG, and mne-bids writes the MEG spelling into EEG sidecars. The
  value is right and the key is not, so every EEG dataset carried an undeclared
  field while the declared one read as missing.
* :func:`repair_array_types` wraps a bare scalar in a list where the schema
  types the field as an array of one entry per frame or per run. Generalised
  from the PET fixup, which had it first because dcm2niix does this on
  single-frame PET.
* :func:`fill_agnostic_fields` writes the values that belong to the DATASET
  rather than to a modality, chiefly where the study was done, into every
  sidecar whose datatype declares them. They used to reach electrophysiology
  alone, because the only enrichment pass that ran was the EEG/MEG one.

None of this guesses. A key is renamed only when the schema declares that exact
name modulo case, a value is wrapped only where the schema says array, and a
field is written only when the user supplied it and the schema declares it for
that datatype.
