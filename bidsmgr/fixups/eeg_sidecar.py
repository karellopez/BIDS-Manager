"""Post-write enrichment of EEG / MEG / iEEG / NIRS BIDS outputs.

Runs in the per-subject Phase 2 of the converter, on the staged tree, after
mne-bids has written the recording plus its ``channels.tsv``, datatype JSON
sidecar, and ``events.tsv``. mne-bids fills only what it can read from the
recording (channel counts, sampling rate, power-line frequency, electrode
positions); this step folds in the information the recording cannot carry on its
own, taken from a resolved :class:`~bidsmgr.recording_meta.RecordingMetaSpec`:

* sidecar JSON: reference, ground, hardware/software filters, manufacturer and
  model, software versions, cap details, institution, and optional extras.
* ``channels.tsv``: upgrade generically-typed auxiliary channels (ECG, EOG, ...)
  to their real BIDS type and fill units + description.
* ``events.tsv`` + ``events.json``: rename trigger codes to human-readable labels
  via the task's event map.
* the task sidecar: TaskDescription / Instructions from the task protocol.

The step is additive and best-effort: a missing file or a per-file error is
logged and skipped, never raised, so a single bad row cannot abort the subject.
``PowerLineFrequency`` and electrode positions are intentionally NOT touched here
- the backend already writes them from the resolved per-row value during the
write (they shape the data file and the coordinate files).
