"""Write ``CITATION.cff`` from what the dataset already says about itself.

BIDS 1.11 recognises ``CITATION.cff`` at the dataset root and bidsval validates
it. Every fact it needs is already in ``dataset_description.json``, whose keys
the BIDS schema defines, so this reads them rather than asking the user a
second time.

The field model and the mapping live in :mod:`bidsmgr.editor.cff`, which the
Editor's citation form also renders. One description of the format, two
surfaces, so a field added there appears in both.

Two things this will not do. It will not invent an author list: a citation
whose authors are wrong is worse than no citation, so a dataset with no
``Authors`` gets a ``TODO`` that validation keeps reporting. And it will not
overwrite a ``CITATION.cff`` somebody wrote by hand unless told to.

Qt-free.
