"""Copy already-curated companion files into the BIDS tree (no conversion).

For task logs / behavioural / stimulus data that the user has already curated
into a BIDS-shaped file, the per-row "companion files" links are copied into the
staged datatype directory under the recording's BIDS name. This is a "place and
name" step, not a converter: the file's content is the user's responsibility and
is checked by ``bidsmgr-validate`` afterwards. The set of attachable suffixes is
deliberately constrained (so this never becomes a generic file copier).

An attached ``events`` companion overwrites the events.tsv mne-bids generated
from the recording's triggers (the curated file wins, per the agreed precedence).
