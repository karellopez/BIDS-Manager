"""Every file the Editor writes, written reversibly.

The Editor can now change hundreds of files from one click: fix a finding in
every file it applies to, write a field across a selection, generate the
companion files a recording is missing. A mistake at that scale is not
something a user can undo by hand, so nothing here writes without first
recording what was there.

Three guarantees, in the order they matter:

**Nothing is half-written.** Every write goes to a temporary file in the same
directory and is moved into place with :func:`os.replace`, which is atomic on
POSIX and on Windows. A crash leaves either the old file or the new one.

**Nothing is lost.** The first time an operation touches a file, the original
bytes are copied under ``.bidsmgr/editor/originals/<op_id>/``. A file that did
not exist is recorded as such, so undo deletes it rather than restoring a
mystery.

**Nothing is half-applied.** A failure part way through rolls the whole
operation back, last step first.

State lives inside the dataset, under ``.bidsmgr/``, which is the choice BIDS
Manager already makes for curation history: the history travels with the data.
The cost is a dataset root that must be writable, so :func:`begin_operation`
checks and says so rather than failing on the first write.

Qt-free. The GUI, the CLI and the tests all drive the same code.
