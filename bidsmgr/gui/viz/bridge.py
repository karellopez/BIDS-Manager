"""Where the Qt-free library meets the Qt event loop.

* :class:`QtStore` wraps a :class:`~bidsmgr.viz.store.SceneStore` and re-emits
  its notifications as a signal, coalesced: several commands in one event-loop
  turn reach a canvas as one ``changed`` emission, so a drag that runs three
  commands per mouse move repaints once.
* :class:`JobRunner` starts :class:`~bidsmgr.workers.viz.VizJob` threads, one
  per tag, cancelling the previous job with the same tag, and keeps them alive
  until they finish. ``stop_all`` waits for them before the owner is destroyed:
  destroying a RUNNING QThread aborts the process.
* :class:`ThemeHub` and :class:`SettingsHub` are process-wide broadcasters.
  Every viewer listens to them, so a viewer inside a dialog follows a theme
  swap or a changed preference exactly like the Editor's does. The old
  dialogs (comparison, defacing, the spectrum window) missed both.
