"""The "what this would do" tree, shared by every dialog that moves files.

It shows the dataset the way the dataset is shaped. That sounds obvious and the
first version did not do it: it grouped the moves by the full folder path, so
``sub-001/ses-01/anat`` and ``sub-001/ses-01/eeg`` came out as two unrelated
top-level rows that happened to start with the same text. There was no subject
to collapse, no session to untick, and on a dataset with more than one of
either the list read as a flat pile of paths with no shape at all.

Here a subject contains its sessions, a session contains its datatypes, and a
datatype contains its files, because that is what is on disk. Ticking is
inherited the way a person expects: untick a session and everything under it
goes with it, untick one run and its session shows as partly selected.

Three dialogs use this (rename, edit entities, sessions), which is the point.
The selection rules and the tri-state arithmetic are subtle enough that a
second copy would drift, and a preview that disagrees with what is applied is
worse than no preview.
