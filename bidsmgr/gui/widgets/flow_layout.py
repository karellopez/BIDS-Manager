"""A bar whose controls wrap onto another row instead of forcing a width.

A ``QHBoxLayout`` reports a minimum width equal to the SUM of what its
children need, so a bar of eight controls cannot be made narrower than all
eight of them laid end to end. In a pane the user is meant to be able to
drag narrow, that sum is the floor: the Editor's sidecar could not go below
617 pixels and the content it was there to show could have gone to 62.

This wraps instead. The minimum width becomes the WIDEST SINGLE control
rather than the sum of all of them, and the rows reflow as the pane is
dragged, so nothing is clipped and nothing goes out of reach.

**It is a widget that positions its children, NOT a QLayout subclass, and
that is the whole design decision.** The obvious implementation is to
subclass ``QLayout`` and override ``addItem`` / ``itemAt`` / ``takeAt``,
which is what Qt's own flow-layout example does in C++. In PyQt it puts
``QLayoutItem`` ownership in question: ``QLayout::addWidget`` creates the
item in C++ and hands it to the override, which can only keep it in a
Python list, and at teardown both sides believe they own it. Measured: the
QLayout version turned an occasional pytest-qt teardown flake into three
test files segfaulting on every run, with no traceback, while every test in
them passed. Swapping the layout back for a ``QHBoxLayout`` made the crash
go away, which is how it was pinned down.

A plain widget has no such question. Its children are ordinary child
widgets, owned by Qt exactly as they always are, and the wrapping is
arithmetic in ``resizeEvent``.
