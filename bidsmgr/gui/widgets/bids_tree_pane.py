"""BIDS dataset tree (Editor view, left pane).

Walks ``<bids_root>/sub-*/ses-*/<datatype>/`` and renders the result
as a ``QTreeWidget`` with BIDS-aware coloring:

* directories  → accent
* ``.nii(.gz)`` → text
* ``.json``    → purple
* ``.tsv(.gz)``→ teal
* other files  → dim

Folder-shaped recordings (``.ds`` for CTF MEG, ``.mff`` for EGI EEG)
collapse to a single leaf so the tree mirrors how BIDS treats them
(one recording = one node).

The :class:`BidsTreeDelegate` reads a per-row severity badge published
at ``BADGE_ROLE``. Step 2 leaves that empty; Step 3 fills it once the
validator runs.

Selection emits :pyattr:`file_selected` with the absolute path so
later steps (sidecar form, validation panel) can react.
