"""Round ``QComboBox`` popups and hover tooltips application-wide.

Two things are needed for a combo dropdown to look like the header project
menu (rounded corners, no square frame):

1. The QSS rule ``QComboBox { combobox-popup: 0; }`` (in ``theme.qss``)
   forces Qt's own ``QListView`` popup instead of the native macOS
   ``NSMenu``, which ignores every stylesheet rule. With it the popup view
   honours ``QComboBox QAbstractItemView`` (rounded list + rounded
   selection).

2. The popup still lives in a top-level window with a square OS frame +
   shadow behind the rounded view. This installs an application event
   filter that makes that container frameless + translucent + shadowless
   (the exact recipe the project menu uses), so only the rounded view
   shows. Geometry is captured and restored around the flag change so the
   popup stays anchored under its combo.

The same filter also rounds hover tooltips: the ``QToolTip`` QSS carries a
``border-radius`` but its ``QTipLabel`` window otherwise shows square OS
corners, so it gets the identical frameless + translucent + shadowless
treatment to stay consistent with the rounded GUI.

Defensive: any failure is swallowed so a dropdown or tooltip can never be
broken by this cosmetic pass. Call :func:`install` once, after the
QApplication and theme are set up.
