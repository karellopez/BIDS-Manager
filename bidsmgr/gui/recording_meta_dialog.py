"""Dataset-level recording-metadata editor (the "global changes" surface).

Opened from the inspection footer's "Recording metadata" button, this dialog
edits the dataset-wide enrichment defaults plus the event-code labels, backed by
the same ``<inventory>.tsv.recording_meta.json`` scaffold the scan writes and the
convert verb auto-discovers. Per-row overrides (reference, ground, montage,
line_freq, demographics) live in the inspection table; this is for the values
shared across the dataset.

``montage`` and ``line_freq`` are dropdown-only here too (never hand-typed).
Auxiliary-channel / filter / extras tables are a later addition; this v1 covers
the highest-value fields: device, institution, reference/ground, and the event
map the scan seeded.
