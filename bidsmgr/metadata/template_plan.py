"""What the metadata template should ask, arranged as scope, file, fields.

The dialog used to be hand-built groups: one "Acquisition system" box covering
EEG and MEG together with a single manufacturer between them, and targets
written as ``sub-..._<datatype>.json``. That is wrong in three ways at once. EEG
and MEG are different instruments and a study may run both. A user answering a
form is really answering "what will be in the file that comes out", so the file
is the unit, not the setting. And which fields are mandatory is the standard's
answer at the version in use, not something to assert in code.

This module builds that structure from three inputs and no hand-written lists:

* the **scan**, which says which files a conversion will actually produce, so
  an EEG-only study is never asked about dewar positions;
* the **schema**, which says which fields each file may carry, at what level,
  of what type, with which vocabulary, for the selected BIDS version;
* the **measured** set of what the converters fill by themselves, so the form
  asks only for what the data cannot answer.

Qt-free on purpose: the dialog renders this, the CLI can print it, and it can
be tested without a screen.
