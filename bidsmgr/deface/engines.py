"""The defacing engines, as a table rather than a set of branches.

An engine is a name, an argv template, and the deidentification entry it writes
into the sidecar afterwards. Adding one is adding a row here; nothing in
:mod:`bidsmgr.deface.run` learns a new name.

Every engine is one flag on `niimath <https://github.com/rordenlab/niimath>`_,
which registers a template and its mask onto the subject with a 12-DOF affine
and then blanks the voxels the mask marks for removal. niimath is BSD-2-Clause
and ships its binary in a PyPI wheel, which is how `dcm2niix` already reaches
users here: no FSL, no FreeSurfer, no ANTs, no separate download.

The three engines differ in two ways only:

``robustfov``
    Crop the neck and the inferior slices before registering. Steadier on a
    scan with a long neck or a large field of view, which is most clinical
    acquisitions.

``cost``
    The similarity measure. niimath's default is a fast SPM/FLIRT-inspired
    engine; ``hel`` is the AFNI-style Hellinger cost, slower and occasionally
    better on unusual contrast.

Qt-free, and free of any knowledge of datasets. It is a table.
